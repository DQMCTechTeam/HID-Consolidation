(Questions  16 (a,b,c) of the DQ Statement). (See DoDI 6040.42 and DHA-PI 6040.07)
Note: A random sample of 30 encounters per MTF will provide a statistical confidence level of 90%, with a confidence interval or sampling error range of plus or minus 15%. 
Note:  In accordance with the DHA Coding Compliance Plan, all coding errors identified in audits will be corrected or appealed by the MTF coding staff no later than five (5) business days after notification to the MTF of audit completion. 
Stakeholders may request that DHA Medical Coding Program conduct additional focused audits, in addition to the random audits being conducted for the DQMC Program (i.e., pull an additional number of encounters to be used in a focused audit, on specific clinics or departments).  The focused audits may assist each MTF in targeting its coding improvement efforts, while the random-sample audit results can be extrapolated to assess the overall coding accuracy for the MTF.
